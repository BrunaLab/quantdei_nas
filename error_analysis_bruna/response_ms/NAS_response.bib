The replication files for the project (processed data and code) are here: https://github.com/NASorg/quantdei Please note that it was necessary to split the data into multiple zip files in order to upload it to Zenodo. To get the files and replicate the analysis, these are the steps. 1. Download all the files and put them in a folder. Navigate to that folder in the command line. 2. Combine the files into a single zip file, like this:  cat ./quantdei\_nas\_data.z0* ./quantdei\_nas\_data.zip {\textgreater} ./data.zip 3. Unzip that amalgamated file: (gui tools won't work) unzip ./data.zip Congratulations! Now you should have a folder called "data" that has all of the data.},

	abstract = {Big data is an essential aspect of innovation which has recently gained major attention from both academics and practitioners. Considering the importance of the education sector, the current tendency is moving towards examining the role of big data in this sector. So far, many studies have been conducted to comprehend the application of big data in different fields for various purposes. However, a comprehensive review is still lacking in big data in education. Thus, this study aims to conduct a systematic review on big data in education in order to explore the trends, classify the research themes, and highlight the limitations and provide possible future directions in the domain. Following a systematic review procedure, 40 primary studies published from 2014 to 2019 were utilized and related information extracted. The findings showed that there is an increase in the number of studies that address big data in education during the last 2 years. It has been found that the current studies covered four main research themes under big data in education, mainly, learner’s behavior and performance, modelling and educational data warehouse, improvement in the educational system, and integration of big data into the curriculum. Most of the big data educational researches have focused on learner’s behavior and performances. Moreover, this study highlights research limitations and portrays the future directions. This study provides a guideline for future studies and highlights new insights and directions for the successful utilization of big data in education.},

We suggest that policy rationalities focused on prediction, transparency and data provide the conditions of possibility for Artificial Intelligence to be integrated into, and intensify aspects of, what we term ?computational education policy?.},

	abstract = {This study takes an inventory of a particular type of intermediary organization ascendant within the state-level higher education policy: ideological think tanks. Our inventory identifies 99 think tanks: 59 affiliated with the conservative State Policy Network and 40 with the Progressive States Network. The analysis shows that state-level conservative think tanks (CTTs) are more tightly connected to national networks than are progressive think tanks (PTTs). By narrow margins, CTTs are also better funded and have more robust higher education policy activity than PTTs. The two most common policy issues?state funding and costs and affordability?represent higher education issues of equal salience to conservative and progressive organizations but from contrasting ideological perspectives. This inventory of the landscape of ideological think tanks? activity and their supply of information has implications for future research that might examine policymakers? demand for and utilization of ideological think tank information and services.},

	abstract = {Americans are increasingly divided in their views on higher education, often in alignment with their political affiliations. This study examines how perspectives on one of the most pressing issues in higher education, college affordability, differ across political ideologies. For our analysis, we exploit an original dataset of text appearing on conservative and progressive think tanks’ official websites. Using these text data, we examine how progressive and conservative think tanks frame the issue of college affordability and how their views are similar and distinct across these ideological coalitions. Our findings reveal differences across coalitions with respect to who is responsible for the lack of college affordability (e.g., governments or higher education institutions) and regarding some proposed policy solutions. The greatest areas of convergence are on stated reasons why college affordability is a problem (i.e., the economic imperative) and on two proposed solutions: increasing financial aid and promoting community college enrollment. In light of emerging evidence of contrasting views on higher education across the ideological spectrum, this study illuminates not only differences but also areas of convergence on the issue of college affordability across coalitions. Thus, findings suggest possible avenues for ideologically neutral approaches to addressing the lack of college affordability.},
